# Snakegame
# Introduction

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a classic snake game implemented using Python and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts, along with a graphical user interface (GUI). The objective of the game is to control a snake and guide it to eat food while avoiding collisions with the boundaries of the game or the snake's own body.

# Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

• main.py: This is the main file that contains the game logic, initializes the GUI, and handles user input.

• food.py: This file defines the Food class, responsible for generating and updating the food position within the game.

• scoreboard.py: This file defines the Scoreboard class, which keeps track of the player's score and updates it throughout the game.
